# How to use

1. Ensure that Python version 3.8 or higher is installed on your machine.
2. Install the required packages by running following command on command line

    pip install eel
3. copy the project folder to any of the drives on your wndows machine. The project folder name is SE1 and it contains following files

    Readme.md <br>
    Input.txt<br>
    algorithm.py<br>
    main.py<br>
    MST.bat<br>
    and a folder MST

    MST folder contains following files:

    index.html<br>
    styleSheet.css<br>
    script.js
4. Run the main.py file from Visual code or any other python editor or run the MST.bat file from command line. It will open browser window and display the Test MST Algorithms page.
5. Enter number of nodes and numbert of edges for generating the weighted graph.
6. Add node 1, node2 and weight and click on the button to add the edge. The edge will be displayed in the Edge details text area and it will keep on appending the edges in the text area. Alternatively copy the comma separated edge information from the sample input file and paste it directly in the Edge details text area. Make sure that node start with 0.
7. Select one or both the algorithms by clicking on the check boxes and click on "Run Algorithm" button.
8. If Kruskal algorithm is selected then the MST will be displayed in the Kruskal MST text area. The time taken for executing Kruskal's algorithm will be displayed on the page.
9. If Prim's algorithm is selected then the MST will be displayed in the Prim MST text area. The time taken for executing Prim's algorithm will be displayed on the page.
If both the algorithms are selected then the difference of Kruskal's and Prim's algorithm run time is displayed on the page. If only one of the algorithms is selected then the time difference will be shown as 0.
